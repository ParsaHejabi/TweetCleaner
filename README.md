# TweetCleaner

This app helps Twitter users to delete a batch of their tweets very fast. You have multiple options to clean your tweets such as:

- Choosing a date to delete all the tweets which are created before that date.

- Filter your tweets based on time, content, or the words in the tweet, number of likes, number of comments, etc. Once you are done with filtering them you can delete the filtered tweets.
